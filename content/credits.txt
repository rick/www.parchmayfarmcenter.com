          We'd like to thank the following gracious folks, without whom none of this would be possible:
        
        %ul
          %li
            %a{:href => 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/exothermic/'} Exothermic
            \- for the beautiful Creative Commons licensed photos of the Tennessee State Penitentiary.
          %li
            %a{:href => 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/grovesa16/'} Grovesa16 
            \- for yet more beautiful Creative Commons licensed photos of the Tennessee State Penitentiary.
          %li
            %a{:href => 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/mklingo/'} Max Klingensmith 
            \- for his beautiful photo of construction.
          %li
            %a{:href => 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/sgw/'} Steve Wampler
            \- for his wonderful photo of cash money.
          %li  
            %a{:href => 'http://www.photoshoptextures.com/'} Photoshop Textures
            \- for the blades of grass which make PMFC so *green*.
          %li  
            %a{:href => 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/erlones/'} Erlones
            \- for the little house, which we remixed for our icon.
          %li
            Our homies behind
            %a{:href => 'http://webby.rubyforge.org/'} webby,
            %a{:href => 'http://github.com'} github,
            %a{:href => 'http://jquery.com'} jQuery,
            and
            %a{:href => 'http://ruby-lang.org/'} ruby
            without whom this would be some tedious flash-ass bullshit.
            
          %li
            And, of course, all the shills, liars, wankers, dirty politicians, fat-cats, and grifters responsible for the
            worst idea ever to hit Nashville, TN -- the "May Town Center".  May your PR firms continue to be hacks, your 
            zoning requests be denied, and your sensitive archeological sites be many.
            
            
        Thanks.
