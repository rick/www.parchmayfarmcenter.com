            ParchMay Farm Center is a great idea, but the former Tennessee State Penitentiary is the wrong place for it.

            %span.label Fact:
            ParchMay Farm Center is an idea whose time and place have come.  What better place to stop corporate flight 
            than a site that stopped criminal flight for nearly one hundred years?

            ParchMay Farm Center is incompatible with the Reston-inspired "Glass-Walled Skyscrapers Overlooking Big 
            Pools of Water With People in Suits Walking Around, But Only Until 5 PM, When They All Leave" vision.

            %span.label Fact:
            Some people claim their hopes to build a second Reston in the middle of a cow field will be dashed 
            if they can't pave over half of Bells Bend.  Well, it is true: ParchMay Farm Center won't involve 
            paving over half of Bells Bend.  But people who love pouring concrete, seeing their reflection in big 
            shiny glass-walled buildings, walking around in suits, or leaving at 5 pm will still find plenty to 
            entice them in ParchMay Farm Center.

            This project will destroy the last remaining former state penitentiary in Tennessee.

            %span.label Fact:
            On the contrary, through the 8 bajillion dollars in additional tax revenues ParchMay Farm Center 
            is expected to bring in each year, this project will help Tennessee maintain its prison-industrial
            complex for years to come!
